                    Students2Students is a platform for prospective businesses <br />
                    (students, start-ups, and companies) to pitch their ideas to <br />
                    fellow college students (and others - everyone is welcome). <br />
                    Students can submit solutions to ideas of their choosing with <br />
                    no pre-screening or interview process.

                    Both parties benefit from this interaction. Businesses can get <br />
                    a portion of their project completed for free and scout potential <br />
                    candidates while students get hands-on experience working will <br />
                    real-world applications/projects. This avoids the lengthy interview <br />
                    and any biased judgement to give every student a fair chance at <br />
                    demonstrating their skills whilst gaining experience in the field.
