# Students2Students

### For students, by students.

Many college students these days are struggling to find work in their respective field. Internships are impossible to secure and many jobs require prior experience.
 
Students2Students is a platform for prospective businesses (sutdents, start-ups, and companies) to pitch their ideas to fellow college students (and others - everyone is welcome). Students can submit solutions to ideas of their choosing with no pre-screening or interview process. Businesses will choose solutions they like that satisfy their initial problem and give recognition to good solutions through our credit system. No money is invovled. Both parties benefit from this interaction. Businesses can get a portion of their project completed for free and scout potential candidates while students get hands-on experience working will real-world applications/projects. This avoids the lengthy interview and unequal process to give every student a fair chance at demonstrating their skills whilst gaining experience in the field.
