# Students2Stsudents

### For students, by students.

Students2Students is a platform for prospective businesses (sutdents, start-ups, and companies) to pitch their ideas to fellow college students (and others - everyone is welcome). Students can submit solutions to ideas of their choosing with no pre-screening or interview process. Businesses will choose solutions they like that satisfy their initial problem and give recognition to good solutions through our credit system. No money is invovled. Both parties benefit from this interaction. Businesses can get a portion of their project completed for free and scout potential candidates while students get hands-on experience working will real-world applications/projects. This avoids the entire lengthy interview process to give every student a fair chance at demonstrating their skills whilst gaining experience in the field.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
