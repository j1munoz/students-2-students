# Students2Students
### To students, from students.

Many college students these days are struggling to find work in their respective field. Internships are impossible to secure and many jobs prior experience.

Students2Students is a website that allows prospective businesses (student, start-up, or company) to pitch their ideas and have college students (and others; everyone is welcome) to submit their own solution to the pitched problem. This provides an equal opportunity for all students the chance to contribute to a real-world project. The best submitted solution will be chosen by the business and awarded credit in our credit system. Both parties, business and student, benefit from this interaction. Businesses get a portion of their ideas completed and view potential candidates while students get hands-on practice dealing with real-world applications; no hypothetical programming challenges to solve.
